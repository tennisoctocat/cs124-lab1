    <h2>The existing list</h2>

    <div>
        <iframe src="state1.html" height="640" width="360" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe>
        <p>
        This shows the existing list with the item "Text John".
        To rename the item, click on the menu icon. The menu icon is already clickable.
        Note that not only do we have a "Rename" option here, but we also have the options to change the priority 
    level of the todo item, as well as to delete the item entirely.
        Renaming, changing the priority level, and deleting the item are all tasks that we would rather not happen accidentally, 
        so putting them under a menu ensures that the user will not accidentlaly take these actions.
